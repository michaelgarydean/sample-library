# projects/ vs. library/recording-projects/
- The upper level projects directory compiles samples created from various production projects, such as an EP or performance
- The recording-projects directory in the library directory is for sampling projects, studio sessions or research/development that were not created as a by-product of some composition project.

# Samples within production projects should be organized into the following categories:
- Length
	- Samples	- Short, one shot samples. Often percussion.
	- Loops		- Samples of a few seconds or measures intended to be looped.
	- Slices	- Short segments that were neither designed as loops, nor are short enough to be percussive samples.
	- Stems		- Recordings of several seconds or greater. Intended to be used in their entirety as long-form materials.
- Type
	- Drums		- Kicks, Hi-Hats, Snares
	- Aux		- Auxillary percussion.
	- Bass		- Low-frequency content intended for bass.
	- Pads		- Tonal sounds that lack a distinct attack.
	- Leads		- Tonal sounds with a distinct attack.
	- Textures	- Non-tonal, non-melodic sounds (such as field-recordings).
