# Preamble
I find myself happiest when I feel I have purpose. Creativity has often been that purpose. Art has helped me uncover some deep questions from my subconscious. It’s also given me a feeling of worth, a sense of belonging. No matter where I am, being part of an artistic community has made me feel welcomed and inspired.

These communities have often been real-world situations, but they’ve also existed entirely online. Imagine how many significant relationships have been founded through Soundcloud. Copyright has now left its effect. It seems the importance of decentralization becomes amplified when the never ending conquest to own or exploit repeatedly comes at the expense of community.

And in the end, art movements are not the result of a single individual, but of a group. I can only imagine what is to come, given the network. It’s exciting. Capitalism and profit-over-all has instilled many ideologies, but I continue to question what ‘ownership’ really means. This may be part of a much bigger question, but I do think peer-to-peer collaboration has been, and will continue to be, definitive in the progress of society, and therefore the arts.

I’ve started releasing my materials on a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license. I won’t use GitHub for hosting these files forever. Once I figure out somewhere I can make everything permanently available, I will update the library to be accessible via .torrent files. Hopefully, this can support these the values I’ve mentioned. I hope by sharing our work we can inspire each other, spark collaboration, and continue to encourage a culture sharing.

# sample-library
Audio sample library taken from projects created for the Wiklow downtempo music project.

# Folder naming
- all lowercase with spaces in filename replaced with dashes
- date format is day-month-year, using only numbers. Day and month are two digits while year is four.
- separate items in a title using an underscore
- ex. eastern-townships_17-03-2016

# projects/ vs. library/recording-projects/
- The upper level projects directory compiles samples created from various production projects, such as an EP or performance
- The recording-projects directory in the library directory is for sampling projects, studio sessions or research/development that were not created as a by-product of some composition project.

# Categorization
Samples within production projects should be organized into the following categories:
- Length
	- Samples	- Short, one shot samples. Often percussion.
	- Loops		- Samples of a few seconds or measures intended to be looped.
	- Slices	- Short segments that were neither designed as loops, nor are short enough to be percussive samples.
	- Stems		- Recordings of several seconds or greater. Intended to be used in their entirety as long-form materials.
- Type
	- Drums		- Kicks, Hi-Hats, Snares
	- Aux		- Auxillary percussion.
	- Bass		- Low-frequency content intended for bass.
	- Pads		- Tonal sounds that lack a distinct attack.
	- Leads		- Tonal sounds with a distinct attack.
	- Textures	- Non-tonal, non-melodic sounds (such as field-recordings).
